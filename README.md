# BOOKMAN 
- Centralized file management project
## Problem
- During my time at school and was bought a laptop by my family. I'm an avid reader, so I often have the habit collecting electronic books (e-books) in the form of .pdf,.. more genres..
- Over time, the number of books increased to 30gb, and this number is constantly increasing year by year.
- Therefore, the need to develop an application to manage the document warehouse in an easier way is necessary
